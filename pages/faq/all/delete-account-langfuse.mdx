# How to delete a Langfuse Account?

## Langfuse Cloud

Before requesting account deletion, you must first delete or remove yourself from all organizations ([docs](/docs/administration/data-deletion#deleting-a-project)).

Once you have removed yourself from all organizations, please reach out via the [in-app support widget](/support) to request deletion of your account.

## Self-hosted Langfuse

If you are using a self-hosted Langfuse instance, you will need to delete any data associated with your projects manually from your database.
